        JACOB MO - Client Report
    </h2>
    <p>
        How did you decide what content and images to use for your site plan?

        How did you communicate with your developer? Was there any issues with communication?

        Did your developer meet your expectations for your site?

        What will you do differently next time you hire a team to do a project for you?

    </p>
    <p>
        I decided what content and images to use for my sight plan by looking at what other similar real world architecture firms used for their websites and found similar ones online. Over the span of this project my developer for my website came up to me multiple times to make sure the website was coming along properly, and there was no issue with communication. My developer kind of met my expectations for this site because he got the general vision of the sight, but it ended up feeling not as "modern" as I expected. This is not his fault though becasue I think some of the stuff I wanted requires more complicated programming which can't be expected in a intro Web class. Next time, I think I will try to make my wireframe with all the colors implemented so that the devs do not have to guess where each color goes, as that was a big source of confusion.

    <h2>
        Lead Developer Report
    </h2>
    <p>
        How did you manage your development team and comunicate the tasks for your junior devs?

        How did you communicate with your client? Was there any issues?

        How did you handle publishing your clients site and sharing it with the client?

        How was your experience with managing your site with GitHub?
    </p>
    <p>
       I managed my development team and communicated the tasks for my junior devs by setting up my Github in a clean way so they were able to quickly see what needed to be done and where do they need to work. I communicated with my client by talking to him in class multiple times throughout the project to make sure I was makin ghis website how he invisioned it. I handled publishing my clients site and sharing it with the client by emailing him the git hub generated link once I was finished with the site so he could look over it. Overall, my experience iwht managing my site with Github was super smooth. I had little to no problems with workign with my junior devs or Git hub in general.

    <h2>
        Junior Developer Report
    </h2>   
    <p>
        How did you communicate with your team lead? Was there any issues?

        Did you know what was expected of you for each site?

        Were you able to contribute to your sites?

        Did you run into any issues with GitHub and adding your changes to the sites?
    </p>
    <p>
        I communicated with my Team Leads by going up to them in class when I had questions. At first I had the problem of not knowing who my Lead devs were so I had to ask the teacher who they were and it took a bit to find them, but other then that there was not much more problems. I knew exactly what was expected for the first Junior site I worked on but for the second I was confused. When I asked the Lead dev, he said that the client just said to take creative liberty in what we would think work best so I did that. Overall I was able to contribute to the site pages I was in charge of and did not run into any issues with Github working on them.

    <h2>
        General Experience and Reflections

    <p>
        What was the most challenging part of this project for you? Were you able to overcome it?

        What did you enjoy most about this project?

        What would you do differently if you could do the project again?

        Do you feel more confident in working on real-world projects after this experience? Explain.
    </p>
    <p>
        The most challenging part of this project for me was figuring out all the Client, Lead Dev, and two Junior dev jobs I was in charge of. I was able to overcome this by just trying my best to follow the teachers directions in class and eventually I figured stuff out. The thing I enjoyed most about this project was making the site plan. I really enjoyed having complete freedom with what type of website we could plan and what we would include on it. If I could do this project again, I would much more prefer just making my own website instead of someone else's because I think for a Intro To Web class its important to understand the whole pipeline of creating a website for youself from start to finish, instead of only working on bits and pieces of it per project. I only slightly feel more confident working on real world projects after this expereicnce because the way that the teams and organization was set up was really hard to follow at times. In the real world I understand that there will still be confusing people and frameworks to projects, but I think with this being a class instead of a full time job where people only work on their work at certain times, it got a little tedius waiting for people to do their stuff. However I think it was good practice for everyone to have to work on the same project files with a github because understanding that is a very important skill.
